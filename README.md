## Cascade Classification Intro

To find a particular object, we decided to use Haar-Cascade Classifiers. [This Self Driving RC Car by Zheng Wang](https://zhengludwig.wordpress.com/projects/self-driving-rc-car/) explains how to implement real-time object detection with Haar-Cascade Classifiers. More details on how to train the classifier can be found in [a post by Thorsten Ball](http://coding-robin.de/2013/07/22/train-your-own-opencv-haar-classifier.html).

OpenCV supports Cascade Classification. [Official OpenCV Document](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/objdetect/doc/cascade_classification.html) on Cascade Classification gives explanation about its theoritical background and implementation. Cascade Classifier Training process is explained [here](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/user_guide/ug_traincascade.html). I recommend to refer to the official document when actually implementing the Cascade Classifier with OpenCV.

Quick note on Cascade Classifier with OpenCV:

  * To train, we separate training data to positive examples and negative ones.
  * Positive exampels should include the target object.
  * Depending on the generalization level of the object, we need more positive examples to train.
  ie. to recognize faces, we need hundreds or even thousands of images of faces with variety features.
  * Positive examples can be generated from one or a few images with OpenCV build-in function, opencv_createsamples.
  * Negative examples must not include the target object.
  * Negative examples should be made manually.
  * Negative examples sometimes called background samples or background sample images.
  * Opencv provides many command line arguments to prepare examples for classification.
  * To capture images from a video, OpenCV has VideoCapture function.
  * OpenCV, opencv_traincascade, fucntion [train prepared examples](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/highgui/doc/reading_and_writing_images_and_video.html#videocapture-set).
  1. Common arguments: specify basic information to train.
  2. Cascade parameters: specify stage type (only boosted classifier is supported today), feature type (Haar-like feature olocal binary petterns), and width and height (should exactly same values as used during training samples creation).
  3. Boosted classfier parameters: type, minimal desired hit rate, max false alarm rate, weight trim rate, max depth, anmax weak count.
  4. Haar-like feature parameters: mode (BASIC:use only upright features, or ALL:full set of upright and 45 degree rotatefeature set).
  5. Local Binary Patterns parameters: no param available

To be accurate, 1000 positives and 5000 negatives are suggested in some articles.

## Cascade Classifier Testing Process

1. Get negative sample images and put it in './negatives' (NOT containing object that you want to recognize)
2. Get a source positive sample image and put it in './positive_source' (containing object that you want to recognize)
3. Generate .txt for negative samples [find ./negatives -iname "*.jpg" > negatives.txt]
4. Generate complete positive images to train on [mkdir positives && cd positives && opencv_createsamples -img ../positive_source/'image-name'.jpg -bg ../negatives.txt -info annotations.lst -maxxangle 0.5 -maxyangle 0.5 -maxzangle 2.0 -w 80 -h 40]
5. Convert annotations.lst to vector file [cd .. && touch coffeeCup.vec && opencv_createsamples -info positives/annotations.lst -vec coffeeCup.vec -num 900 -w 80 -h 40]
6. Conduct cascade training [mkdir classifier && opencv_traincascade -data classifier -vec coffeeCup.vec -bg negatives.txt -numStages 1 -minHitRate 0.8 -maxFalseAlarmRate 0.5 -numPos 10 -numNeg 5 -w 80 -h 40 -mode ALL -precalcValBufSize 1024 -precalcIdxBufSize 1024]
